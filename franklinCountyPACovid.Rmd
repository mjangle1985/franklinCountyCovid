## Current Data

The data within this model is limited. There exists no easy package in R for PA Coronavirus cases by county. I've entered in this data manually. 

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
#load libs
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")

franklinCountyCorona <- data.frame("day" = c(seq(1,13)), "dates" = seq(as.Date("2020-03-20"), by = "days", length.out = 13), "cases" = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 11, 12, 19, 21))

```


##Fit

The fit model

```{r fit}

fit <- lm(formula = log(cases) ~ day, data = franklinCountyCorona)

summary(fit)

````


##Using the model

Using the model to generate data for an additional amount of time. Placed in final model

```{r use}
newDay <-data.frame("day" = c(seq(1, 30)))
nextTwentyDays <-predict(fit, newDay)
nextTwentyDays <- as.data.frame(nextTwentyDays)
tmp <- seq(as.Date("2020-03-20"), by = "days", length.out = 30)
names(nextTwentyDays)[1] <- "cases"
#has a null value assume model starts at 1
nextTwentyDays[1,1] <- 1
nextTwentyDays <- mutate(nextTwentyDays, 
                         "day"   = c(seq(1, 30)), 
                         "cases" = ceiling(10^log(nextTwentyDays$cases)), 
                         "dates" = tmp)
finalModel<- merge(nextTwentyDays, franklinCountyCorona, by = "dates", all = TRUE)
````

##Plot the data

Used the data from the model to plot 

```{r plot}
ggplot(finalModel, aes(x = dates)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = cases.x), color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(y = cases.y), color = "red") +
  geom_path(aes(y = cases.x), color = "grey") +
  geom_path(aes(y = cases.y), color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Dates", y = "Cases") +
  ggtitle("Franklin County PA confirmed Covid19 Cases Model 30 Days") +
  theme_bw()
```
